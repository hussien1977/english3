B. Read what Richard says about a mall in England. What does he like?  
We’ve got a big mall in Manchester. I like going there with my family. It has lots of good shops. I like the sports shops and the ones that sell video games. There are loads of clothes shops. My father likes the electronics shops. He likes buying things for his computer. I like going up and down in the lift because you can see everything.  
The mall has lots of restaurants. There isn’t a supermarket, so we can’t go food shopping. There are plants and trees everywhere, and there’s a big car park underground. It has three floors. Sometimes my father can’t find his car when we go home. It’s very funny!

1 Does the writer like the Panther 3.0D? How do you know?  
CAR OF THE YEAR AT ONE OF BAGHDAD’S MOTOR SHOWS:  
I'm here at one of Baghdad's motor shows, and the car everyone is talking about is the Panther 3.0D. The new Panther is Car of the Year, and it's really fantastic. Some people just stand and gaze at its beautiful shape. Some young men want to sit in the driver's seat and dream. However, this car is not just good-looking; it is also a hybrid car. With its combination of an electric motor and petrol engine, this fuel-saving car is good for the planet, and good for your pocket, too! The Panther is self-charging, so you don’t need to worry about finding charging points. You just drive like you always do.  
It is not only the driver who will be impressed by the Panther 3.0D. Inside, children can sit in the back and try the electric seats and windows while their older brothers and sisters play with the built-in video-game player. These are standard for all models. Extra features include: GPS, the sunroof, tinted windows and an excellent Bluetooth connection.  
Switch on the engine and it runs so quietly. All of the features are really fun to try. But there's more! There's loads of space inside. The Panther 3.0D has seats for eight people – two in the front, three in the middle and three in the back. And there's space for all of their bags.  
It looks very expensive, but the Panther 3.0D is actually quite cheap. And you don’t need a lot of money to run this car. It does 12 kilometres to the litre and has a four-year warranty.  
But there's something even more important. This is a really safe car. You don’t have to worry in an accident. There are airbags for the driver and passengers and many other safety features. The Panther 3.0D really is the Car of the Year!

B Look at the photographs. What is being described?  
Mountain bike    Lightweight tent  
1 It’s waterproof, and it’s easy to put up.  
2 It has disc brakes to help you stop quickly in the rain.  
3 It sleeps two, so it is big enough for us.  
4 It is fast and safe.  
5 It is strong and insect-proof.  
6 It is made from nylon, so it is light and easy to carry.  

Who are the people in the conversations?  
Discuss the new vocabulary. What do the words mean?  

Compound words  
Words in English are sometimes made from two nouns.  
Example:  
windproof = made from material that wind can’t get through  
disc brakes = brakes that use discs  
Can you think of any other compound words? Look in Lessons 1 and 3 in the Student’s Book.  

A Giving reasons  
There are disc brakes to help you stop quickly.  
It has the latest suspension to help you keep on the road.  
It is easy to put up so you won’t waste time.  
There are clear instructions, so you can put it up easily.  
Think about the features of the Panther 3.0D. What are they for?

How are you? I'm now in 3rd Intermediate at school and I'm enjoying my lessons. My best friend at school is Sally. She is really creative, so she likes the Art lessons. She paints really well. I want to learn and she said she will teach me. She's very helpful. I said I will help her with her Maths homework. She likes Maths, but she's not very good at it.  
Sally is very nice-looking, but a bit short! She's got beautiful curly, brown hair and dark brown eyes. She's very kind and really good fun. She's also very friendly, and I think we're going to be good friends for ever!

2. What is the name of the new book Kareem wants to buy?  
3. What does ‘saving up’ mean in paragraph 1?  
4. What do you think the collection of poems *Islands of Salt* is about?  

NEW RELEASE  
from bestselling poet  
Mudhafar Al-Nawab  
Come to Al Saqi Bookshop on 23rd November and get your copy of Al-Nawab’s new collection of poems *Islands of Salt*.  
PLUS an extra special prize for the 50th customer of the day!  

Kareem went to Al Mutandobi Street and hurried towards Al Saqi bookshop. As he got closer, he saw there was a long queue forming outside the door to the shop, and his heart sank. He had been saving up for months and wanted to be the first one to buy the new book by his favourite poet – now he would have to wait in line. As he stood waiting, the hard-working schoolboy pulled the advert for the new book out of his pocket.  
Kareem had read all of Al-Nawab’s poems at least twice and found them very interesting. The quiet boy spent most of his free time reading or writing his own poems and his parents, friends and teachers all said he was very imaginative. It was Kareem’s dream to be a famous poet himself one day.

B  
Read about two malls. Which mall is better? Tell your partner why.  
This mall is called a StudyMall. You don’t spend money or buy things here! A StudyMall is all about getting children and families learning in different ways.  
The StudyMall is designed for education. It has a library, a museum, an art gallery and classrooms. The classrooms are large, light and comfortable learning environments, and visitors have access to computers, the internet, headsets, 3D printers and a digital library.  
At the StudyMall, adults and children can join workshops and training programmes for free. StudyMalls are about more than spending money – they educate and teach you skills for life!  

I want to tell you about a new type of mall called an EcoMall. This type of mall is all about looking after the environment. The building of an EcoMall is made from recyclable materials such as steel, iron, glass and wool. It is surrounded by thousands of trees and plants, and it has a roof garden. There is a small café on the roof where people can relax and enjoy the views. An EcoMall doesn’t use any fossil fuels. It uses energy from the wind and the Sun.  
The mall has lots of shops and cafés like normal malls. However, the shops sell sustainable food, clothes and beauty products, so you can enjoy shopping without killing the planet!  

C  
Work in pairs. Discuss the sentences. Do they describe the StudyMall or the EcoMall?  
1 You don’t need money in this mall.  
2 There are some great paintings in this mall.  
3 You can enjoy a drink outside here.

Wonderful! Very, very funny! Fantastic!  
Lucy Fisher, 16, talks to STAR!

the new TV comedy, The Badri  
Family.  
In this comedy, I play Samara,  
the daughter in a traditional  
family. I live with my mother,  
father and younger brother.  
(1) My brother is very clumsy and  
is always having silly accidents.  
(2) In the first episode, he  
accidentally put salt instead of  
sugar in my mother’s tea and it  
tasted awful! In every episode  
he trips over a lot and drops  
things.  
I really enjoyed filming the latest  
episode because we go away  
as a family on a holiday.  
(3) We stay in a fancy hotel  
with a swimming pool and my  
brother falls in the pool with all  
his clothes on! He gets soaked.  
(4) Later that day, he spills his  
drink at lunch and then slips in  
the puddle. (5) Next week, we  
are filming an episode where  
my brother puts cleaning fluid

Lesson 8: My favourite movie  
A Read the fact file and answer the questions.  
1 What three jobs does Barnum do?  
2 How does Barnum attract new customers to his circus?  
3 Who does Barnum rescue?  
Fact File  
Title: The Greatest Showman  
Released: 2017  
Genre: Musical  
Director: Michael Gracey  
Scriptwriter(s): Jenny Bicks and Bill Condon  
Stars: Hugh Jackman, Zac Efron, Michelle Williams  
Main characters: PT Barnum, Phillip Carlyle, Charity Hallett, Caroline and Helen Barnum  
The story: It is the early 1800s. PT Barnum gets married to Charity Hallett, the daughter of the family he works for, and they have two daughters, Caroline and Helen.  
When Barnum loses his job as a shipping clerk, after the company goes out of business, he gets a loan from a bank and opens a wax museum, showing wax figures of famous people.  
The museum is not successful, so he decides to find some live acts.  
Barnum renames his business Barnum’s Circus and becomes the ringmaster. He meets Phillip Carlyle, who agrees to join the circus if he gets 10% of the profit. To attract more customers, Barnum starts to show ‘freak’ performers, which include a bearded lady, a dwarf man and an extremely tall man. However, although these acts bring in bigger audiences and more money, they also create poor media reviews and complaints.  
One day, Barnum finds his circus on fire. He rushes into the fire and rescues Carlyle. After the fire, everyone decides to stay with the circus. Barnum wants to spend more time with his family, so he hands over the circus to Carlyle, who uses his money to rebuild the circus and make it a huge success.  
Interesting facts: The musical is based on the true story of PT Barnum, a famous American showman and entertainer, and his creation of a circus. The film made 435 million US dollars!  
My opinion: I don’t usually like musicals, but I loved this film! The songs are absolutely brilliant, and the story is incredible. I challenge you not to cry!

1 What was Karam’s favourite sport?  
Karam was a very talented student. He enjoyed school, and he was really good at sports – especially basketball. In fact, he played basketball for his school team. Karam also liked to help others. He helped his mother in the kitchen, he helped his father in the garden and he helped his two younger brothers with their homework.  
One day, Karam’s mother asked him to go to the bakery to buy some bread. However, while he was walking, he saw a little girl run into the busy road. At the same time, a large car was speeding quickly along the road towards the girl. Karam saw the car, but the little girl didn’t. Karam ran into the road and pushed the girl to safety.  
2 What challenge did Karam overcome?  
The car screeched to a stop. All the people on the street stopped and looked. The little girl was fine. She ran across the road to her family, who gave her a hug. Sadly, Karam was lying in the road. He had been hit by the speeding car, and his left foot was badly injured.  
Karam was taken to hospital. The doctors and nurses worked hard on him. Unfortunately, they couldn’t save his foot. Karam suffered a lot during his treatment, and he felt very sad. He thought that this was the end of his sporting life. Would he ever be able to play basketball again?

But Karam was lucky. He had a loving and supportive family. His parents and all of his family members visited and helped him during his treatment. After a few months, he was able to use crutches, and he returned to school. Everyone was happy to see him back at school, and he had no problems at all academically.  
However, Karam still felt sad. Sport had been an important part of his life, and now he couldn’t do it. His teachers tried to encourage and support him by explaining all the other activities he could do, such as art, playing chess, joining a debating club and cooking. But none of them were basketball. Karam missed the physical activity, the speed, the teamwork and the competition of his favourite sport.  
One day, Karam’s PE teacher told him about a wheelchair basketball team in his city.  
But Karam didn’t have a wheelchair.  
‘Don’t worry!’ said the PE teacher. ‘I will offer you one!’  
So, Karam joined the team. Very quickly, he learnt how to turn, stop and sprint with his wheelchair. It was quick and light, and it felt like part of his body. Once again, he felt the speed, teamwork and competition of his favourite sport. He was soon good enough to become a member of the national team, and he began to participate in many international contests, where his team won several titles.

PAGE 31
Comparatives:
- England is colder than Iraq.
- The dawn is more beautiful than the night.
Grammar rules: 
- Add "er" to short adjectives.
- Use "more/less" with longer ones.

PAGE 30
Unit 3
Lesson 1: Our world
A Read each category and look for the examples in the photographs. Then add two or three more examples for each category.
1 wild animals (e.g., tiger)
2 birds (e.g., crow)
3 farm animals (e.g., cow)
4 habitats (e.g., grazing land)

B Use the adjectives in the box to describe the photographs. Does your partner agree?

Adjectives:
beautiful, large, dangerous, small, dry, useful, hot, huge, wet

1. England is colder than Iraq.
2. I am quieter than my brother.
3. The dawn is more beautiful than the night.
4. The night is less beautiful than the dawn.
5. Tablets are more expensive than phones.

How to form comparatives of adjectives:
1. Adjectives with one syllable: add “er” → cold → colder
2. Adjectives with two syllables: add “er” → quiet → quieter  
BUT, if the second syllable is “-ful”, use “more” or “less” → useful → more useful  
Note: clever, gentle, friendly, quiet, and simple can be used with “-er” or “more/less”

3. Adjectives with more than two syllables → use “more/less”  
Example: beautiful → less beautiful

Another way to compare things:  
(not) as + adjective + as  
Example: A bear is not as fast as a lion.

1 What did the rich merchant sell?  
3 What did each son buy?  

Long ago, there lived a wise and rich merchant in Iraq. He spent his working life buying and selling gold, animal skins, silks and salt. He had a lot of land and he lived in a large, strong house with a beautiful garden.  

However, after many years, the merchant became old and tired. He decided to give his riches to his three sons because he wanted to spend more time relaxing in his garden.  

The merchant's oldest son was called Majid, his second son was called Ali and his youngest son was called Hamad. The merchant called his sons to him and told them his plan.  

'My children, I want to give my riches to you today, while I am alive. My land is easy to cut up, and I will give each of you a piece of land that is the same size.'  

2 What did he give to his three sons?  

'Thank you, Father,' the three sons said.  

'But what about the house?' asked Hamad.  

The merchant smiled. 'That is a difficult question. I cannot cut up my house! So, I want my house to go to my cleverest son.' Then the merchant opened his hand to show three small coins.  

'Take one coin each. Take it to the souq and spend it. The son who buys something that can fill this room, will have the house. Go now and return before night.'  

Each son took a small coin and went to the souq.  

Majid entered the souq. The first stall he saw was full of baskets, mats and straw.  

'Straw!' he shouted. 'Straw is cheap, and it fills up space!' He returned to the house with sacks full of straw.

How to fill a space  

Ali entered the souq. The first stall he saw was full of goats, rabbits and birds.  

'Feathers!' he shouted. 'Feathers are cheap, and they fill up space!' He returned to the house with sacks of feathers.  

Hamad entered the souq. He walked around the souq and he thought and he thought. Then he had an idea.  

Majid and Ali waited for Hamad to return to the house. They waited and they waited. The hours went past, and he did not arrive. Then, as the sun disappeared and night started, Hamad arrived.  

Majid and Ali laughed when they saw Hamad. He had nothing! 'Hamad will not get the house,' thought Majid and Ali.  

The three sons entered the house together and stood in front of their father.  

The merchant asked his oldest son to go first. Majid emptied the sacks of straw around the room. When he finished, the room was half full.  

'Well done!' said their father. 'Now it is Ali's turn.'  

Ali emptied the sacks of feathers around the room. When he finished, the room was half full.  

'Well done!' said their father. 'Now it is Hamad's turn.'  

Hamad stood in the middle of the room. He had no sacks. Then he took a long, white stick out of his jacket. It was a candle. Hamad placed the candle in the middle of the room and lit it. The light from the candle filled the dark room with light.  

'What a clever idea!' said Majid and Ali laughing. 'Our little brother is the cleverest son!'  

'Yes,' said the merchant. 'I think we all agree that the house will go to Hamad!'  

Then the three brothers joined their father and mother for a delicious evening meal.

Read the text. Match each heading with a paragraph.  

| Bees in Iraq | Making a bee helper | Solitary bees |  
|---|---|---|  

1. I want to help bees where I live. Here in Iraq, we usually think about honey when we think about bees. We have kept honey bees in Iraq for thousands of years. There are ancient inscriptions on clay tablets with recipes using honey to treat skin problem. However, I want to help solitary bees.  

2. Some bees live on their own, like the solitary bee. These bees are small bees that move from flower to flower. They don’t produce honey, but they have a very important role, because they are pollinators. Farmers benefit because these bees pollinate crops and increase the harvest. However, solitary bee populations have decreased in the last 20 years because their habitats have been lost.  

3. I made a bee helper to give solitary bees a home. First, I got some old bamboo sticks and I cut them into 10 cm lengths. I scraped out the middle to make them hollow. Then, I made a wooden box and filled it with the hollow sticks. Finally, I used some wire to hang it up on a sunny wall. I hope that bees will come and visit my bee hotel!

Get some metal wire and some nuts. Thread the nuts onto the wire. Do this several times. When you have enough nuts on the wire, make a circle and tie some string around the wire before hanging it in a tree.  

2  
Cut a grapefruit in half. When you have eaten the fruit, keep the skin. Put two sticks through the skin in a cross shape. Tie some string to the sticks and fill the grapefruit skin with seeds. The birds can stand on the sticks when they eat the seeds.  

4  
Take some oil and melt some fat in a bowl. Roll the oil and fat into a ball. Then roll the balls in a bowl of seeds to make seed cakes. Make a small hole in the cake to thread some string through, then hang the cakes up outside.  

D Choose an animal from Exercise B. Design and make your own animal feeder for this animal. Count how many animals use your feeder. Share your design and the number of animals that used your feeder with the class.

Lesson1: Listening  

Remember! When a person is speaking in English, you don’t have to understand every word. Use these tips to help you.  

💡 Listening tip 1 - Listen for the loud, slow words.  
People often say the important words more loudly and more slowly.  

What are the important words here?  
Can I have your attention, please?  
We have a report of a young boy missing in the shopping mall. His name is Jamal. He has curly black hair and brown eyes. He is seven years old and is wearing a sweater, a white shirt and blue jeans. He also has white shoes and socks.  

A 🎧 Listen to two speakers. What are the important words in each case?  

💡 Listening tip 2 - Listen for the loud sounds in words.  
Long words in English have one loud sound. This is often the only sound you will hear clearly from an English speaker. You must learn to recognize long words from the loud sound.  

What are the loud sounds here? at tion missing curly swe ter  

🎧 Listen to some long words from the course. Write the words you hear.  

💡 Listening tip 3 - Listen for repetition of the words.  
Don’t worry if you don’t hear important information the first time. People often say the important information twice.  

Notice how the speaker repeats the information in a different way.  
That’s a young boy called Jamal with curly black hair and brown eyes, wearing a red sweater, a white shirt and blue jeans.  

C 🎧 Listen to two announcements.  
Remember the important information in each case.

Unit 4 Lesson 2: Reading  

📖 Reading tip 3 - Read the first paragraph.  
Newspaper story  
The first paragraph tells you what the article is about. It usually tells you also:  
• where the news happened  
• when the news happened  
• who was involved  

Sometimes the whole article is just one paragraph.  
Magazine article  
The first paragraph tells you what the article is about. It also tells you if the article is in the first person (I). It talks about opinions or experiences.  
Story  
The first paragraph usually sets the scene. For example:  
• where the story happened  
• when the story happened  
• who the main characters are  

Read the first paragraph of the article in your Student's Book page 7: Car of the Year!  
Read the first paragraph in your Student's Book page 24: Schoolgirl in new TV comedy  
Read the first paragraph in your Student's Book page 40: How to fill a space  

📖 Reading tip 4 - Read the topic sentences.  
Paragraphs in English usually begin with a topic sentence. This sentence prepares the reader for the information in the paragraph.  
Magazine article  
All the topic sentences together usually make a good summary of an article.  
Story  
All the topic sentences together usually give you the gist of the story.  
Newspaper article  
Topic sentences are not so important in newspaper articles. Each paragraph may only have one sentence.  

Find and underline the topic sentences in the article in your Student's Book page 24: Schoolgirl in new TV comedy  
Find and underline the topic sentences in your Student's Book page 40: How to fill a space  

C What information is in these paragraphs?  

CAR OF THE YEAR!  
I'm here at one of Baghdad's motor shows, and the car everyone is talking about is the Panther 3.0D. It is not only the driver who will be impressed by the Panther 3.0D.  
It looks very expensive, but the Panther 3.0D is actually quite cheap.  

HUNTING WITH BIRDS  
More than a thousand years ago, the people from the deserts of Arabia, the Bedouin, used to watch falcons catching birds and animals for food.  
The Bedouin used to hunt on camels.  
One disadvantage of this sport is that too many rare birds might be killed.

Dr Ramzi I was born in Mosul.  
Reporter What were you doing before you became a famous dentist?  
Dr Ramzi Well, I was already a dentist, and I was reading a lot at home and keeping in touch with a large number of dentists in different countries around the world.  
Reporter I see. So what changed your life?  
Dr Ramzi One day, I was treating a tooth for one of my patients. It was badly decayed and needed to be pulled out. Everything was fine, but all of a sudden the gum started bleeding. I tried and tried until I finally succeeded in stopping the bleeding. I resumed my work again. It was a lesson for me to work harder and find newer, smarter methods to treat bad teeth.  
Reporter What happened then?  
Dr Ramzi I participated in different workshops on using lasers in dentistry. I opened a large new dental clinic using modern equipment to make my work more successful.  
Reporter Are you happy with your work now?

Boy saves child  

A BOY FROM THE UK was a hero yesterday when he saved a child from a dangerous animal.  

The child’s mother, Esra’a Al-Bayati, 26, told our reporter, ‘I was going to the shops with my daughter, Salma. She’s just five years old. We were walking across the park, and Salma was playing with a ball. Suddenly, a big black dog ran up to us. It seemed very angry, and it barked at Salma. Then it jumped on her and knocked her down. It was horrible.  

A boy was playing football nearby. He kicked the ball at the dog. The ball hit the dog hard, and it ran away.’  

The boy was John Smith, 13, who is in Iraq for one year with his family. John said afterwards, ‘I’m not a hero. I saw the little girl was in trouble, so I kicked the ball at the dog. It was a lucky shot.’ John plays in the football team at Baghdad International School.

School party  

Last Thursday’s party was supposed to start at 10 a.m., but when I arrived at 9:45 the hall was already full. I had to stand right at the back and I was struggling to see or hear anything. The students around me were chatting loudly while the arts team were performing. I’m not sure if the performance was any good as I couldn’t hear much of it, but the rest of the audience clapped at the end so they were enjoying it. I was disappointed I didn’t enjoy it as much. Next time, I will try and get there earlier to make sure I get a good seat. Sara  

Al-Quds Intermediate School hosted the concert of the year last Thursday. The party was really amazing. By 10 a.m., the hall was full and everybody was smiling. The students were wearing their uniforms and everyone was waiting patiently for the party to start. When the curtains went up on stage, the lights went down and a hush spread through the hall. The school arts team opened the show before some talented students did some solo performances. They all performed well and you could tell they had practised a lot. When they had finished, the audience clapped loudly. Dalia

Lesson 8: A website for me  

Before launching a new magazine or website, it’s good to do some research to find out what the readers find interesting. Read the following information about the popularity of sports in different countries.  

The most popular sport in the world is football (or soccer as some people know it). Football is the top sport in many countries, including Iraq, the UAE and the UK. In the USA, most people prefer American football while in India cricket is the favourite. In China, the most popular sport is basketball. Which sport is your favourite?  

AB Imagine you are creating a new magazine or website for the students in your school. What would you include? Do a survey of your classmates and find out what the most popular features are. Create a tally chart in your Activity Book to show the results.  

Example:  

| Feature    | Tally |  
|---|---|  
| sport    | 🟨🟨 II |  
| music    | 🟨 I |  
| fashion    | 🟨 |  
| puzzles    | 🟨 I |  
| true stories    | 🟨🟨 |  
| cartoons    | 🟨🟨 II |  

Work with your partner and discuss the results of your survey. Use the words most, least, some and a few.  

Most people like reading cartoons. It’s the most popular feature. Some people enjoy true stories and sport and a few people like music and puzzles best. The least popular feature is fashion.

Story time  

A powerful lesson for everyone  

A 💡 Listen, read and find out.  

What was the ‘powerful lesson’?  

Every year, Al Sabah newspaper makes a special offer to two young students from local schools. In the summer holidays, these students can work as reporters on the paper. They can see what reporters really do in their jobs, and they can learn to write reports.  

Last summer, Salam Ahmed was the lucky boy. He was 15 years old, and he wanted to be a reporter. On his first day at the paper, he took a new reporter’s notebook and his camera. One of the reporters was showing Salam his desk when the editor came in and said, ‘A big new restaurant is opening in Baghdad next Tuesday. I need someone to write a good report on the event.’

### PAGE 61  
A powerful lesson for everyone  

‘I can do it,’ Salam said.  

On Tuesday, Salam took his notebook and camera and went into the new restaurant. Salam watched everything, but one special thing attracted his attention. A young boy was taking his old father, who was in a wheelchair, to the restaurant for a treat. The boy bought his father some food. The father was very old and weak and dropped food on his shirt and trousers while he ate. Many of the other customers watched the old man in disgust, but his son looked at him with love and respect.  

After the old man had finished eating, his son, who was not at all embarrassed, quietly took him to the washroom and patiently wiped the food from his clothes, combed his hair and straightened his spectacles. When they came out, the entire restaurant was watching them in dead silence, not able to grasp how someone could embarrass themselves publicly like that.  

The son, very proud and pleased, started walking out through the crowd with his father. As they left, a wise old man called out to the son and asked him, ‘Don’t you think you have left something behind?’  

The son replied, ‘No sir, I haven’t.’  

The old man said, ‘Yes, you have! You left a lesson for every son and hope for every father.’  

The restaurant went silent. Salam was watching everything and followed the boy and his father. After asking them questions and taking notes, he thanked the boy and kissed the old man on his head. Salam made his very first report about this touching story, and it was praised by everyone.  

What questions do you think Salam asked the young boy? Can you think of three?

Inspiring Nurse  
Makes a Difference  

**By Adil Alsarraf**  

Do you ever think about the people around you who make a difference? These people keep our roads in good condition so traffic and services can keep moving. They put themselves in danger to stop crime. They create beautiful images for us to enjoy. They clean our streets, and they even give money to charity. My aunt Sana is one of these people, so I interviewed her about how she makes a difference.  

My aunt makes a difference by helping people get well after an illness and become healthy again. She is 42 years old, and she has been a nurse for 17 years. After training for three years, she started her career, and today she is working in a health centre in Ramadi. I asked her what her favourite part of the job is, and she told me that it is working with young people and children because she enjoys helping them get better when they have been sick. However, being a nurse can be tough, so when she is not working she reads and knits to relax. Her dream is to travel, and she really wants to visit Australia in the future.  

I am really proud of my aunt. Because of her, I want to make a difference when I am older, too. I hope to be a writer and give joy and new knowledge to my readers.

A Read the text and answer the questions.  

1 What advice would you give Mona?  
2 Which reply below is the most sensible advice? Why?  
3 Which reply is the worst advice for Mona? Why?  

Mona is 18. She has been worrying about what she is going to do after her exams next year. Some of her friends are planning to go to college and study further. Others are leaving school and getting jobs in shops and offices. Mona is confused and cannot decide what is best for her, so she starts a blog and invites anyone and everyone to give her some ideas and advice.  

Hi everyone. I’m Mona. Please help me decide what to do when school finishes next year. Shall I get a job or shall I continue studying? I really don’t know what job I want to do. I enjoy Science, Maths and Art and I am getting good grades, but I really don’t like being away from home. Thanks! Mona  

Hi Mona. I think you should give up school and work in a shop. You could live at home and you would be using your Maths every day. You would have money to spend from your job, too! 😴 Fatima  

Hi Mona – you should really go to college. Until you decide what job you want, you need to stay in education. Ask your teachers for advice and do some research about different jobs and how you become qualified to do them. If you find a job you really enjoy, you will be much happier! Fouza  

Mona, make sure you apply for university now. You are good at some very important subjects and you must study Medicine. It will take a long time to become a doctor, but you will earn good money and have a very important job. Give up Art – it is useless and will not help you in life. Leena  

Dear Mona, I think you need to go to a language school in another country like me. It’s great fun and you meet lots of new people. Dalia

Lesson 4: The school of the future  

A B Hassan has entered a competition to design a school of the future. Read his entry and match the headings with the paragraphs.  

a A ‘super school’ b Global education c Virtual learning  

1 Schools in the future will be very different to schools now. There will be much more technology and students will only need to come in to the actual school buildings once or twice a week. Most of the teaching and learning will take place over computers which are connected to the internet in students’ own homes. Teachers will deliver lessons using the internet at times to suit each student. Students will also be able to use the internet to communicate and discuss work with other students.  

2 I think there will be fewer small schools in the future because students will learn mostly at home. There will be one ‘super school’ in each town or city that students of all ages come to and use the fantastic facilities. There will be sports facilities, a science park, a museum and a mosque. Young people who are interested in Science or Music will be able to study at the special buildings designed for those subjects.  

3 This new way of learning will make it possible for students to connect with other students and teachers all over the world. If someone has a special interest in something, they can search a global database to find a teacher who can teach that student all about their chosen specialism. The schools of the future will teach many subjects that are important for Iraq’s future because students will be able to learn from experts all around the world.  

A Giving more information about people and things  

Relative pronouns who, that/which  
To explain which person or thing you are talking about, you can add information after who, which or that. Use who for people and which or that for things.  

Example: The schools of the future will teach many subjects that are important for the future … Find more examples in the text.  

B Read the text again. Find three sentences with the relative pronouns who, that and which.

Lesson 7: A famous career  

A B Read the text quickly. Match the underlined words from the text with their meaning.  

A famous career  

Abu Ali al-Hasan Ibn al-Haitham was born in 965 in Basra, Iraq. He went to school in Basra and Baghdad, and later he travelled to Egypt and Spain. In Europe, he was called ‘The Physicist’. He is also sometimes called ‘al-Basri’ after his birthplace, Basra in Iraq.  

We don’t know much about Ibn al-Haitham’s early career. We do know that when he was in Egypt, the Caliph needed him to regulate the flooding of the River Nile. He proposed a hydraulic system, but the task was impractical at the time.  

People called Ibn al-Haitham the ‘Father of optics’. His most famous work is Kitaab al Manazir (Book of Optics), which is in seven volumes. This great work was translated into Latin and many other languages. He did many experiments on the movement of light, colours and reflections. He also gave a scientific explanation of the parts of the eye and the process of vision. In 2015, the UNESCO celebrated Ibn al-Haitham’s achievements in Optics, Mathematics and Astronomy.  

He was one of the most eminent physicists who ever lived. All the Medieval and Western scientists of optics based their work on Ibn al-Haitham’s theories on light and optics. He wrote more than 200 works and also contributed to the fields of Mathematics, Medicine and Physics. Most of his works are now lost, but more than 50 of them have survived.  

This successful and famous mathematician died in 1040, possibly in Cairo.

A 🎧 Listen, read and find out.  

1 How is Dalia different from her classmates?  

Once, there was a girl called Dalia, who came from a simple family. Her parents had died, so she lived with her old grandparents. Dalia was an only child, and she knew that when she finished school, she would have to get a good job so she could help her family.  

2 What job did Dalia get after school?  

Dalia enjoyed school and she worked hard in her classes. In particular, she liked studying Maths. Dalia had two classmates, who were called Huda and Mariam. They both came from rich families, and they did not enjoy going to school. In fact, they were never happy about anything. They complained about getting up early in the morning, they hated wearing a school uniform and they moaned about going to school. All they wanted to do was to play games and chat on their phones.  

One day, Huda asked Dalia, ‘Why do you study so hard? You are not enjoying life!’ Dalia replied, ‘I enjoy learning new things. Many children in the world can’t go to school. We are very lucky to have our education.’ But Huda and Mariam just laughed at Dalia’s response.  

Months passed. Soon, it was time for Dalia to take her final exams, which she passed. Now, it was time to leave school and start to work so she could help her grandparents, who were too old to work. Dalia soon got a job working for a farmer.

Story time Hard work pays  

Dalia worked hard on the farm. She became acquainted with the latest reports on farm management, which helped her make decisions about buying new, disease-resistant seeds, modernizing the farm’s systems and marketing the farm’s products to customers at the local market.  

Dalia enjoyed seeing the farm thrive under her care, and two years later, the farm was turning a profit. The farmer was happy with the changes to the farm, and he started paying Dalia a good salary. Dalia used her money to support and care for her grandparents, but she also had an idea for her own business, which would give management advice to other farms. She began to save her money and make a plan for her future.  

A few years later, Huda and Mariam, who were still bored and lazy, decided to visit Dalia’s business. They were very surprised to see that Dalia was now a powerful businesswoman who was running a successful company. ‘How did you do this?’ asked Huda, as she gazed around the company office.  

‘Well,’ replied Dalia. ‘Nothing ever comes to you, that is worth having, except as a result of hard work. You should try it one day.’

- The Netherlands is very flat, so people there often ride bicycles.

- North Americans hardly ever walk. They nearly always use cars.  
- Because London is an extremely crowded city, most people who work there travel by bus or underground every day.  
- People who live in cities in India often travel by rickshaw.  

Business hours  

British schools and government offices are usually closed on Saturdays and Sundays. Shops used to close on Sundays, but now most of them are open. Banks and post offices are open on Saturday mornings. People who work in Britain often start work at nine in the morning and finish at half past five in the afternoon. Business hours in European countries that have hotter climates than Britain are different. Shops and offices close after lunch and open again at four or five in the afternoon.

Wednesdays at 7:30 See the first of 12 travel programmes on Wednesday this week. Each week, a different adventurer travels to some of the greatest natural features on Earth. The most famous rivers, mountains, deserts and volcanoes in the world are visited in this series and the photography is stunning.  

Week 1 John Wilson, from the United Kingdom, goes on a journey through Africa down the Nile, the longest river in the world. He travels by boat for most of his journey. It begins at Lake Victoria and follows the White Nile to Khartoum. It continues slowly down to Lake Nasser in Egypt, past the cities of Aswan, Asyut and Cairo. John has many adventures before he reaches the end of his journey at the Mediterranean Sea.  

Week 2 Alan Bridges, from Australia, aims to do the 1,000-kilometre journey through the Himalayas from India to China. He does the first 250 kilometres on horseback, riding carefully through the foothills of the mountains to Mount Everest. Then he climbs higher on foot for another 100 kilometres. Although this is very tiring, Alan says it is the best way to enjoy the fantastic scenery. Although he soon becomes exhausted and is unable to complete the whole distance, this programme still makes wonderful viewing.  

Week 3 Fared Lafta, from Iraq, travels by hot-air balloon over the world’s largest desert, the Sahara. Lafta’s goal is to fly right across the desert from the Atlantic Ocean to the Red Sea. The journey ends unhappily with a helicopter rescue in Niger, but there are fantastic views of the Sahara from the balloon before the adventure comes to its unexpected end.
